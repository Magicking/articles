What's the problem?

I listen and discover musics quite frequently and while I'm sometimes steady on
sorting them, I usually end up in a mayhem with a bunch of musics in multiple
playlists making me unable to listen to my themed playlist with my recently
discovered musics.

I use the Spotify heart button that put songs in the « liked playlist », a bunch
of them are in the localized « My Shazam playlists » (Shazam localizing the possessive pronoun, you get a playlist for each language used on your phone)
and I even have some songs in quite a few playlist on YouTube.

What's the manual sorting  process?

On my best days, I would find some time during transportation to do a first
sorting of the weekly new musics and put that directly in a themed playlist
(with a name loosely based on the feelings I would get from the music when I
hear it).
On the bad days, I would even forgot to hit the like button on Spotify, I lost
countless music I would binge for a week just because I would forget to click
that damn button!
So the ideal multi-stage process would be to:
 - sort the music I'm listening directly
 - sort the music I have in my liked playlist
 - sort the music I have in my Shazam playlists
 - sort the music I listened to recently even if it's not in a playlist anymore

Some aids that could facilitate sorting:
 - What's the music type?
 - Is it in other playlist?
